# **FitNex - AI Powered Fitness Tracker**  
_A project developed as part of the **AICTE Internship**_

---

## **About the Project**
**FitNex** is an AI-powered workout assistant designed to help users track their workout repetitions accurately. Using computer vision techniques and real-time pose estimation, the app analyzes workout videos or live webcam feeds to provide feedback during exercise sessions. This project is the foundation for a full-fledged AI fitness trainer application, with plans to add advanced features and an improved user interface.

## **Features**
  - Automatically detects arm movements and counts bicep curl repetitions.
  - Works with both pre-recorded videos and live webcam streams.
  - Displays the count of left and right arm bicep curls live on the screen.
  - Visualizes key landmarks (shoulder, elbow, wrist) and angles during the workout.
  - Has user-friendly Streamlit interface for uploading videos or analyzing workouts via webcam.
  - Powered by the YOLOv8 pose model for precise keypoint detection.
